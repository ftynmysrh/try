<h2 align="center">HEY ! IT'S ME FATIN NUR MAISARAH BINTI NASRUL</h2>

<font face="Fugaz One"color="#5C0A31"size="5"</font> 
<p align="center">Hello, Assalamualaikum. My name is Fatin Nur Maisarah Binti Nasrul. I'm from Johor Bahru. Also, I was born in Hospital Sabah and grew up in Johor Bahru. My mom and my dad also born in Sabah but only my siblings that born in Hospital Sultanah Aminah and Hospital Sultan Ismail Johor Bharu. I was born in February 2004. When, I was a kid my father likes to take us as a family out for a walk to enjoy the beauty of nature. My mother also like to take a random picture of me and my siblings neither it's good or not. My brother likes to being alone and don't want anybody to disturb him but he like to disturb anyone he likes. Also, my little brother like to eat any food that my mother cook beacause he easy to get hungry that's why he the one who gain weight a lot. My little sister that always like to selfie anywhere and anybody who she really like, her will like to take a selfie together also she's the one who extrovert in the family meanwhile me and the entire family were opposite of her.
<br><br>
Then, I really like to help my mother do some chores or cook some dishes, since I like baking some cookies my mother always request to me to make some of cookies. Also, I like to playing a game such as PGR, wuthering waves, and reverse: 1999. I really enjoy game that more to adventure and storyline that I can understand some of story game that developer make. I like to being alone either being to social with friends, because I hate to being judge of other people but actually I really don't care about them as long as I don't have to talk with them. I also have only three friends that I only feel comfortable with. Only them that I can show my crazy personality and my happiness side. Then, my favourite food and favourite drinks were chicken chop and juice carrot susu. Also, my favourite color are purple, pink and beige. I really like to stick to my family members and my friends, only them that I can talk whatever I want to talk until they became stress to talk with me :) . I actually really like to ask them a random questions that they don't know how to answer it or to responds of my questions. But I know that they're really love to be friend with me as long as I don't do unecessary things to them. I really hope that my friend's don't stab behind my back and talk dirty about me so that our friendship will strong and I still want to enjoy our memories together.</p>
